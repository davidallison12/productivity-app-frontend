## Technologies & Approach
The main functionality of our app involves creating goals and task using our goal and task components in our front-end React. To handle our data in the backend we used Express and Mongo DB. This handled our models and controllers and routes, which was pretty straightforward to setup. We also used MongoDB to store user, goals & tasks information. We used Heroku and Atlas to host our data and application. 

We also used internal modules like CORS to to help our front end app communicate with our backend. 

As far as styling our app we chose to use the frontend framework Bootstrap. Having some experience with it in during previous projects helped to quickly add some nice asthetics and functionality to our application and will allow us to do expand on more ideas to enhance the user experience. 

## Unsolved Problems
React is a very powerful tool but also a little intimidating to debug, so it's hard to get too adventurous once you have code that works. That being said we were able to figure out most things regarding fetching APIs and our data. A deeper knowledge of React would probably allow us to add more functionality, add more styling and make calling our routes easier by using hooks, etc.
